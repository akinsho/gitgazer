Gitgazer is a TUI application that allows you keep track of the repos you ~~spy~~ ðŸ‘‰ _gaze_ upon the most.
You can see how the star count has changed over the course of a day or week or month (TBD).
You can see the most recent issues as well as the issues you've tagged/tracked.

## Goals

- [x] Decide on main layout for the application
- [x] Handle authentication
- [x] list repositories you've starred (paginated)
- [x] Select a subset of repositories as your focused ones
- [x] Store this list locally so it can be retrieved later
- [ ] Create config file
- [ ] Persist credentials at a configurable path
- [ ] Track the star count for a repository by time window e.g. day, month, year
- [ ] Visualise star count graphically
- [ ] See issues you are watching and track updates since you last checked
